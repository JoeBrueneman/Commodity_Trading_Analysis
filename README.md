Coffee is a highly traded good internationally among many countries. It is also a heavily imported good for the U.S.
But what affects the price?
Questions
Coffee vs. Stock Market 
What are the stock prices of major players vs coffee prices and do they correlate?

Coffee vs. Global Economy
Is GDP of major coffee-producing countries influenced by the price of coffee globally?
 
Coffee vs. Pandemic
Did unemployment during the pandemic increase the consumption/price of coffee?

Coffee vs. Commodity
Does the price of Oil (West Texas Intermediate) or Natural Gas impact the price of imported coffee from major players?



Hypothesis
There will be a significantly positive relationship in the the price fluctuations between fuel (oil/natural gas) and coffee. 
Null Hypothesis
Due to the labor-intensive nature of the coffee production industry, global coffee prices will be primarily driven by other factors, such as labor costs, rather than the fuel prices that affect freight costs.




Hypothesis

The coffee price changes will drive fluctuations of those countries’ GDPs.

Null Hypothesis was
There will not be a correlation between the major coffee producing countries’ GDPs and the coffee prices. 




Hypothesis
The global coffee price increases will negatively impact the stock prices of major coffee companies.
Null Hypothesis
Since the raw coffee price is not the only cost associated with the coffee companies’ performances in the stock market, there will be no correlation between the global coffee price and the major coffee companies’ stock prices.
lol




Hypothesis
There will be an inverse relationship between unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and coffee prices.
Null Hypothesis
A slowdown in the labor market during the pandemic will not impact coffee prices because coffee is a major staple in people’s daily life.
